I'm learning the why's and hows of coding and the associated rules and structures needed for one to follow along with to properly write the code needed to execute functions.I don't like feeling wasteful regarding ones ability to learn and wants to give back useful ideas so others may learn too.Lucy has taught me what it feels like to swoon to the moon and back again.
